# Spotify-God-Playlist
You can add certain songs with a controlled amount of popularity on a scale of 1-100 to your playlist using your playlist's id. In early stages of development, currently working on making a UI for the project.

Right Now:
- Will have to input your spotify API key
- Is limited to console
